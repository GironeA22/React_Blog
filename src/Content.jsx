        content: "Mr. Torgue, originally from the planet Hephaestus, was raised by his grandmother after his parents were killed in an explosion in an Eridium mine, sparking his resolution to master the power of explosions. With facial hair and pectoral muscles at a very young age, Torgue was shy around girls in school and was made fun of for being different. Torgue's first explosive weapon (simply a Jakobs rifle with dynamite taped to the barrel) nearly killed him, and after several dozen tests, he finally succeeded in creating his first functioning weapon. He would later sell his designs and company to the Torgue board of executives for $12 and a high-five. He maintained a position at Torgue purely for 'PR reasons' and his job is solely to be the face of the Torgue company.",

        descriptor: 'Manipulated by her superiors and being the lone survivor of her squad, Moze left the Vladof military behind and became a Vault Hunter with her mech Iron Bear.',
        content: "Moze was originally a soldier in the Vladof army's Ursa Corps, a mechanized infantry division that utilized bipedal, 15-ton 'Iron Bear' mechs. She became a battle-hardened veteran of many ludicrously dangerous battles across the six galaxies and rose to the rank of Gunner First Class. According to the terms of her enlistment contract, she was obligated to fulfill a quota of missions for Vladof before quitting if she wanted to take her mech, Iron Bear, with her. Moze's superior, Kaziak, manipulated her into staying on longer by constantly extending the quota and playing on her guilt with claims that her absence would jeopardize the lives of new recruits who depended on her experience, much to her chagrin and anger. Moze finally decided to quit after one final mission to Darzaran Bay. The rest of her squad perished, leading to Vladof assuming her death as well. With the pain of losing her squad still fresh, she trusts only her mech, whose insides are dotted with photos and memorabilia from her past. After striking out on her own, the rising costs of maintaining Iron Bear eventually pushed Moze to travel to Pandora and seek treasure as a Vault Hunter with the Crimson Raiders.",
