        content: "Mr. Torgue, originally from the planet Hephaestus, was raised by his grandmother after his parents were killed in an explosion in an Eridium mine, sparking his resolution to master the power of explosions. With facial hair and pectoral muscles at a very young age, Torgue was shy around girls in school and was made fun of for being different. Torgue's first explosive weapon (simply a Jakobs rifle with dynamite taped to the barrel) nearly killed him, and after several dozen tests, he finally succeeded in creating his first functioning weapon. He would later sell his designs and company to the Torgue board of executives for $12 and a high-five. He maintained a position at Torgue purely for 'PR reasons' and his job is solely to be the face of the Torgue company.",

        descriptor: 'Formerly from Eden-5, Gaige is a genius who invented the personal defense robot D374-TP, more commonly referred to as Deathtrap.',
        content: "Gaige was a high school student from the planet Eden-5, she would often ECHOcast live about what was going on in her life. Gaige found the history behind the Vaults, Eridium, and Pandora to be particularly fascinating, and considered her era to be 'the most awesomely awesome time period in history' to be living in. She originally conceived Deathtrap, then called the Mechanized Anti-Bully Deterrent Test, or Project DT, as a science fair project to combat bullying. Her rival, Marcie Holloway, was a contestant in the science fair as well, and used her father's money to buy her way through the competition. After Gaige was inspired to amputate her left arm with a particle saw and replaced it with a robotic one she built, Marcie apparently stole Gaige's DT designs and sold them to Eden-5's corrupt police force. On the day of the science fair in the school auditorium, Marcie's father bribed the judges, helping her win first place with a defective robot based on Deathtrap's first or second revision blueprints. Marcie then shoved Gaige, causing Deathtrap to identify her as a hostile. Deathtrap attacked with its digistruct claws, which unexpectedly caused her body to explode the moment her skin was touched (likely all over Gaige as well), due to a miscalibration of the claws by Gaige, likely when she had added the discord circuits the night before.",

        descriptor: 'Manipulated by her superiors and being the lone survivor of her squad, Moze left the Vladof military behind and became a Vault Hunter with her mech Iron Bear.',
        content: "Moze was originally a soldier in the Vladof army's Ursa Corps, a mechanized infantry division that utilized bipedal, 15-ton 'Iron Bear' mechs. She became a battle-hardened veteran of many ludicrously dangerous battles across the six galaxies and rose to the rank of Gunner First Class. According to the terms of her enlistment contract, she was obligated to fulfill a quota of missions for Vladof before quitting if she wanted to take her mech, Iron Bear, with her. Moze's superior, Kaziak, manipulated her into staying on longer by constantly extending the quota and playing on her guilt with claims that her absence would jeopardize the lives of new recruits who depended on her experience, much to her chagrin and anger. Moze finally decided to quit after one final mission to Darzaran Bay. The rest of her squad perished, leading to Vladof assuming her death as well. With the pain of losing her squad still fresh, she trusts only her mech, whose insides are dotted with photos and memorabilia from her past. After striking out on her own, the rising costs of maintaining Iron Bear eventually pushed Moze to travel to Pandora and seek treasure as a Vault Hunter with the Crimson Raiders.",
